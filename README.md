# Task Tracker

My task tracker is a list of tasks that you can add to, set reminders for, and remove. If you double-click on a task on the home page it sets the reminder to true.
Below you can see the main page and the reminder functionality.

You'll want to run a JSON server by typing "json-server --watch db.json --port 5000"

Once you have a server running, you can add your own tasks.
