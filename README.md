# Task Tracker

My task tracker is a list of tasks that you can add to, set reminders for, and remove. If you double-click on a task on the home page it sets the reminder to true and adds a thick border to the left side of the task. Below you can see the main page and the double-click reminder functionality.

To use this code you'll need to type a few commands into your command line:

1 - "git clone https://github.com/spaceC00kie/reactToDoList"

2 - cd into the directory

3 - "npm i"

4 - "npm start"

5 - "npm run server" 

Once you have a server running, you can add your own tasks.
