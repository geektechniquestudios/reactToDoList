# Task Tracker

## What is this?

My task tracker was made with the intent to sharpen my react skills. This program lets you create a list of tasks that you can add to, set reminders for, and remove. If you double-click on a task on the home page it sets the reminder to true and adds a thick border to the left side of the task.
