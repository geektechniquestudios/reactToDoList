# Task Tracker

My task tracker is basically an editable to-do list with the option to set reminders and dates for the tasks. It has a black background to be easier on the eyes with a light center window for visual clarity.

You can see all your tasks on the main page, a button to add a task, and a link to an About page. If you double-click on a task it automatically sets a reminder. The Add button opens fields to set a title for a task, a day and time, and a box to click to set a reminder.
