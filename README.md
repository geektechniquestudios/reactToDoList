# Task Tracker

My task tracker is basically an editable to-do list with the option to set reminders and dates for the tasks. It has a black background to be easier on the eyes with a light center window for visual clarity.

You can see all your tasks on the main page, a button to add a task, and a link to an About page. If you double-click on a task on the home page it automatically sets a reminder.

The Add button opens fields to set a title for a task, a day and time, a checkbox to set a reminder, and a button to save the task. At the same time the green Add button turns into a red Close button in case you decide not to set a task.

Following the About link shows the version number and a Go Back link.

You'll want to run a JSON server by typing "json-server --watch db.json --port 5000"
